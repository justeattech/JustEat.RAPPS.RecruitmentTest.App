# **Senior Developer (Restaurant Apps) - Job Specification**

## Responsibilities

Every member of the Technology team is responsible for:

* The availability, security, scalability of our e-commerce platform

* Delivering our product roadmap

* Planning for the future

As a Senior Developer in the Restaurant Apps team you and your team will own several components that integrate with the existing e-commerce platform and which are used by restaurants to receive online orders and manage invoices. 

The team will be responsible for planning the future technical direction of the Restaurant Apps components, as you add new features that enhance the JUST EAT service. The team will work with Product and UX teams to improve the applications & tools used by the restaurants.

We are moving increasingly towards mobile development and are in a unique position in that we own an entire vertical slice of the platform - from top to bottom.

We use a wide range of technologies (e.g. .NET, Ruby, Windows, Linux, CouchDB, MySql) so flexibility, the ability to adapt, an interest in learning new technologies and the ability to select the right tool for the right job - given JUST EAT’s imperatives - is core to the role.

You’ll be working daily with Web API, Windows services, web interfaces and mobile interfaces (Android tablets at the moment; iOS and Android phones soon) - as requirements dictate.

We don’t divide responsibility for development and operation of our platform, so you and your team will support the changes you make all the way through to operating successfully in production at peak times.

## Principles

Our principles are at the core of how we meet our responsibilities. As a senior member of your team, you'll need to demonstrate those principles and make them a core part of how you work day to day:

* Do the right thing

* Take responsibility

* Be transparent

* Continuously improve

* Take pride

## Part of an effective team

Our engineering teams are growing because we have a huge number of ideas of how to improve the experience customers and restaurants have. As a Senior Developer you play a key role in ensuring that your team can efficiently turn those ideas into reality. You'll need to:

* Become a trusted technical authority and specialist in one or more technical areas of your team. You’ll be someone the rest of the team and your Technical Lead can turn to for engineering advice and guidance.

* Track the progress that you are making towards the wider goals of your team, and transparently communicate that progress to your team and Technical Lead.

* Keep to the processes, standards and designs that your team has agreed.

* Ensure you and others continuously improve by proposing and then implementing new processes, designs and engineering practices that make your team more effective.

* Contribute to the definition of product features, including in workshops with other engineering teams and Product Management.

* Collaborate with other engineering teams that produce the APIs you consume, and use their feedback as a basis for improvements.

* Communicate the technical work of your team to other engineering teams.

* Take responsibility for supporting your changes all the way through to proving that they work well - and continue to work well - in production.

## Part of a healthy team

As well as responsibility for your own work, everyone is responsible for the overall health of their team and the people in it. You'll need to:

* Mentor less experienced developers, in both technical skill and practical engineering knowledge.

* Help induct new members of your team, and instill our common responsibilities and principles in them.

* Generate enthusiasm and a sense of pride within your team for both the product features you build and the engineering skills you apply to problems.

## What can you expect from us?

* We’ll believe and trust in you and your abilities. So you and your team will have the authority to make the technical decisions you need to meet your responsibilities to the rest of the platform and company.

* The opportunity to become a senior and authoritative voice within the engineering team of a large and successful, but still fast growing company.

* An environment in which good, evidence-based arguments are always listened to, and will win out.

* 5 days for training of your choice each year, and support toward the costs.

* Regular 1-2-1 meetings with your Technical Lead, with support and guidance to set and then meet personal career objectives.

* An open, friendly and fun environment; we have a relaxed dress code and regular social events, including sundowners every Friday.

* Hackathons - use your imagination, ideas and technologies of your choice to innovate and deliver prototypes of new products.

You must have experience of:

* Designing and developing systems for both high availability and scalability

* Applying problem solving skills to technical issues

* C#, .NET 4, Visual Studio / SQL Server

### You'll have an advantage if you have experience of:
